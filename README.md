# Successor-Model-Flow-Matching
This repo implements TD flow algorithms on a demonstrative continuous state, continuous action domain

Currently, the code implements MC-CFM for a continuous gridworld environment. In the upcoming commits, we will add alternative TD flow algorithms as proposed in _Farebrother, J., Pirotta, M., Tirinzoni, A., Munos, R., Lazaric, A., & Touati, A. (2025). Temporal Difference Flows. arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.09817._


## How to run the code?
1. Create a virtual environment and install pytorch, numpy and matplotlib.
2. Setup ipython kernel for the virtual environment.
3. Run the notebook `mc_cfm.ipynb`.
